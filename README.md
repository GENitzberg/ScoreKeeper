# ScoreKeeper
Score Keeper Application allows to track the score of two different football teams.

The goal of this project is to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing.
The game selected for this application is American football, specifically the SF 49ers and the NC Panthers.
There is a button for each of the four amounts of points a team can score - touchdown, extra point, safety, and a field goal.

Have fun playing!
